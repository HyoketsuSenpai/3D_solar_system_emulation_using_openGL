# 🌌 OpenGL Solar System Simulation

This project is a real-time 3D simulation of the Solar System built using **C++** and **OpenGL**. It features textured planets, realistic lighting, and animations for orbit and rotation to visually represent our planetary system.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Scaled planet sizes and orbital distances (not to scale, but proportional)
- ✅ Phong lighting (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- ✅ Texture mapping on all planets
- ✅ Independent rotation and revolution for each planet
- ✅ Smooth animations

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **C++ compiler**
- **OpenGL 3.3+**
- **GLFW** (for window/context/input)
- **GLAD** (for OpenGL function loading)
- **GLM** (for vector/matrix math)
- **stb_image** (for texture loading)
